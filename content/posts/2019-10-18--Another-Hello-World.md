This is just another hello world from another attempt of starting a blog. I have some other blogs in Wordpress, but I want to have another one with static content. I think it is more suitable for portfolio kind of website.

This is my n-th attempt to do it. I have tried to use Jekyll, Ghost, Gatsby, and Hugo (this one). Hopefully, it will be final one. But, who knows :D.

## What's my plan for this website?

I will share my experience related to my technical or professional stuff (a project, work-related, or an event). I will also use it as my main entry point for other to know more about me. I will put my portfolio also, probably. It will be in English.
