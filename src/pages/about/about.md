## Professionally

I am a software engineer who work mostly with Python or C++ who is interested at open source. Lately, I have been working for open source Geographic Information System (GIS), from developing QGIS's plugin, web GIS, to core contribution to open source project like [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) and [GeoNode](http://geonode.org/). I enjoy software development, problem solving, and learn new tehcnologies. You can check [my GitHub account](https://github.com/ismailsunni) about my latest activity.

Beside GIS, I also interested in 3D, Visualization, Artificial Inteligence, and Machine Learning. But the most important is, I can make other people's life easier.

## Accademically

I got my bachelor of science degree from [Institut Teknologi Bandung](http://itb.ac.id/), Indonesia for Informatic Engineering. My final project is about [Sentiment Analysis and Topic Extraction for Public Figure on Twitter](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OInjje8AAAAJ&hl=en#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DOInjje8AAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DOInjje8AAAAJ%3Au5HHmVD_uO8C%26tzom%3D-60). Currently, I am currently studying for [Master of Science in Geospatial Technologies](http://mastergeotech.info/) at [University of Muenster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/) and [Universitat Jaume I](https://www.uji.es/) with a scholarship from the Erasmus Mundus programme.

## Open Source and the Community

I love open source and its community. I helped initiating [Python-ID](http://python.or.id/) community in my home town, Yogyakarta and organized several meet ups. Currently, I am helping creating [QGIS ID or QGIS Indonesia User Group](https://qgis-id.github.io/) community. I am trying more and more to contribute to the beautiful open source community.

## Leisurely

I like to spend my free time with my wife (e.g. she cooks and I eat or travelling together). I love football (Forza [Inter](https://www.inter.it/en)!).  When I have more free time, I write in my personal [blog](https://ismailsunni.wordpress.com/). I am also interested in [One Piece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece) and Math.

I enjoy travelling and visiting new places. Thansk to my works, I have been able to visit 4 continents. I also have lived in 4 countries (Indonesia, South Korea, Spain, and Germany). Let me know if you want me to visit your place!
